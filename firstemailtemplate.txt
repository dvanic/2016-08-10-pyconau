Hi!

Thank you for registering for the upcoming Software Carpentry Beginner Python workshop at the XXX - we are looking forward to working with you! Over the course of the workshop, you'll learn some tools and skills to help accelerate your research, and our hope is that this will save you time and help you better organise and document your research.

Before the Workshop:

1. Please follow the setup instructions at http://daryavanichkina.com/2016-08-10-pyconau/ to make sure your computer has what you'll need for day one, and run the checking scripts at http://daryavanichkina.com/2016-08-10-pyconau/setup/index.html to make sure everything is in place. If you hit any snags, or don't understand what the instructions are asking for, we're happy to help - please send questions to us at d.vanichkina@gmail.com, and/or come to the workshop at 8:00 am on Wednesday so that we can troubleshoot then.

2. Please fill out the pre-workshop survey (as soon as possible!) at LINK??? so we know a bit more about you  - this will *really* help us plan what and how to teach.
