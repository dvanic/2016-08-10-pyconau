What is a Software Carpentry bootcamp?

Software Carpentry is a volunteer organisation whose members teach basic software skills to researchers in science, engineering and medicine. Researchers often spend much of their time wrestling with software, but most are self-taught programmers. As a result, they spend hours doing things that should take minutes, reinvent a lot of wheels, and still donâ€™t know if their results are reliable. To tackle this problem, Software Carpentry runs two-day bootcamps at hundreds of sites around the world.

Who should attend?

The course is aimed at graduate students, early career researchers and others who want to develop their skills and knowledge (NOT necessarily academics!). No prior knowledge of coding is needed. 

What do we teach?

Session 1: The basics: Wednesday August 10,2016 9:00 am - 12:00 pm

The key to being a proficient programmer is solid fundamentals. In this session you'll learn the basics of the Unix shell, which is the cornerstone of software carpentry.

Sessions 2 - 3: Python basics: Wednesday August 10, 2016: 13:00 pm - 17:00 pm; Thursday August 11, 2016: 9:00 am - 12:00 pm

Have you ever wondered how professional programmers write code? In this session you'll learn the common tricks of the trade, via an introduction to the Python programming language. We'll cover functions and loops, and move on to defensive programming, error handling and debugging, as well as introduce unit testing and test-driven development - all of which are skills transferrable to any language, not just python.

Session 4: Version control. Thursday August 11, 2016: 13:00 pm - 17:00 pm

Do you work in a small team that shares text or code? Do you struggle to keep track of multiple versions of the same files (http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1531) ? Would you like an easier way to backup your work? This session will teach you everything you need to know about git, a version control system that can solve all these problems and more.
